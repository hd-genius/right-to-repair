# What is the right to repair?

The right to repair means that you have the right to repair your own belongings instead of having to buy a whole new product. Whether on purpose or not, many manufacturers often make products that are hard, expensive, or even impossible to repair.

# What is this project?

This project aims to provide open source replacements that perform the same as their OEM counterparts. This project also provides reverse engineered electronic schematics and community created diagnostic/repair guides.
